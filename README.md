### Hello!
### My name is Elena and I'm a junior frontend developer with marketing experience 

.
- 🐱‍💻 I’ve recently finished the course on Web-development and have little coding experience so far. But i want to practice it.
- 🏋️‍♀️ I used to work for big companies being a customer for web-developing agencies. Then I started web-coding. Now I know both how it works and what is expected as a result.
- 💬 In this portfolio you may see my achievements in learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, REST API, express.js, Node.js, OOP, BEM method. However I'm also familiar with various marketing automation platforms: Marketo, Pardot, GetResponse, Sendpulse; graphic layout and design tools: Adobe Creative Cloud tools, Figma, as well as various marketing tools for analytics and online advertising. 
- 🚀 My next plan is to learn Wordpress and some headless CMS platform, and learn more about technical SEO.
